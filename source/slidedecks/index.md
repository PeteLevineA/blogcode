12/14/2016: This was a lightning talk I did at the triangle area .net users group. [TriNug Meetup Group.](https://www.meetup.com/TRINUG/) I went a little over the alloted 5 minute time, something I need to work on! I had a lot of fun though and cannot wait to do it again! Once you open the link, hit the "S" key to see my notes. These slides were made with reveal.js
