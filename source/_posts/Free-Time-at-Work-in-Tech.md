I recently had a discussion with other friends in tech as to what they thought ethically about creating something, in tech, during free time at work. I made the argument that in my past there has been down time. In every career there is going to be some down time. Waiting on builds, whole company meetings that may not require your participation, waiting on code reviews, etc. etc.  
 
Many people I know choose to have quiet conversations at work about news, browse websites or make phone calls during this time. I was wondering about those who choose to be more productive and perhaps learn a new technology, write blog posts or contribute to open source code. As a software developer for a company, is it ethical for me to produce something in technologies that I know or am learning during business hours even if I'm using personal resources. 
 
Nowadays in order to even apply to certain job postings, they require some sort of experience or online presence. Most suggest some sort of github activity, active community participation, or a blog. Developers already have so much on their plate right now that I find any off time during the work day that I spend reading hacker news or talking with coworkers to be somewhat unproductive. We have to be experts in the domain that we're working with to effective iterate on the problems we're solving. We have to have intimate knowledge in the technology we're working on. We often have to meet deadlines that weren't created by us, constrained by resources sometimes working more than 40 hour weeks. Lastly we have to stay up to date on newer technologies so that we're still relevant and keep our interview skills sharp lest we forget exactly how to efficiently balance red black trees.

I have been to meetings in the past where our head of department has outlined our budget. A question arose that asked about budget for continued education and training. The supervisor said point blank that in the real world, education and training are the first to go when a budget is under pressure. 
So this is where my question comes from. If we need an online presence, keep our interview skills up to date and train ourselves outside of a normal working day, how do we be successful in all of these items especially if we have other outside items to attend to? How do we as developers continue to be developers if the odds are continuously stacked against us. It's no wonder that software developers and engineers move on to something else or create their own startup after working in the industry for a decade. 
This is where my question comes from. Can we ethically produce an online presence or technical based content using skills we have likely acquired outside of work during work hours in our off time? What happens if that content can be monetized? 
 
I have a friend who stated that browsing websites, taking phone calls, having conversations is all part of a common work place and no one cares about the unproductive downtime use. But, if he caught one of his developers publishing a blog post at 2PM he would be warned and possibly terminated because the content of that blog post could be monetized. He stated the same for pull requests to open source software. If anything that the developer makes can be utilized by a competitor then it is grounds for termination if it's created during working hours no matter how unrelated to the company it is. 
 
I then countered that he sometimes is paid to speak at conferences for technologies he uses at work. There's no way of guaranteeing a competitor isn't in the audience and what, if any, percent of the script or talk was generated at work. What's the difference between speaking about something you've learned about at work, about X, technology than blogging about it? Typically I'd bet he'd make more financially at the conference than he would on ad revenue of an average blog post or youtube video on the subject.  
 
I know some places have a clause stating anything created by an employee using any of the company's resources, ie. Building, wifi, power, etc is their property. In discussion with my friends about this, this is typically something you could probably negotiate at the time of employment. A lot of the time, however, something like this is stated in the employee handbook that we often sign without even reading. I personally know of board/quiet/conference room meetings held by employees talking about an idea that have eventually spawned into a startup or business. Now something like that is extremely difficult, in a court of law, to accuse an employee of doing that using business resources but where's the difference here between writing a blog post or talking to a fellow employee about a cool idea perhaps even using a pad of paper or whiteboard in a conference room. 
 
When I got to this section of the discussion we all came to a similar agreement. It's easy to find a pull request or blog posting timestamp during business hours and hard to find a timestamp for a business idea or script of a conference talk that might have occurred during those same business hours. The best possible solution that we came up with, is to talk to your supervisor or manager and determine what the company expects out of your knowledge and time. We all agreed that almost every one of the uses cases above, no company would likely ever come after you for unless you spawned a business that competes with the core of the business you're working for. However we all had our own answer for whether it was ethical. Is it ethical to produce open source pull requests or blog posts or conference speech scripts during office hours? 
 
It seems like as technology evolves more is expected out of tech workers outside of simply producing code and architecting systems. As our career evolves over time we need to have open communication as to what is expected with our output both inside and outside of work.
