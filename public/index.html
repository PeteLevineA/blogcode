<p>I have a mix of enthusiasm and experience in a myriad of technologies. Based on who may be reviewing my profiles or résumé, I could be anything from a senior software engineer, front-end developer, UI/UX developer, full stack developer, .net developer, etc. etc. etc. After my first 9 years of experience and the dissolution of the startup I was at, I began to really think about my place in the world of software engineering. Where should I take my career? Who am I? Am I really a senior software engineer? I love the front-end, could I be a front-end developer?</p>
<p>In the past, one of my companies had announced a big round of layoffs. The powers that be were being less than open about the state of the team I was on at the time. So I went and spoke to my recruiter about opportunities, where I was at with my career and what I wanted to do. I explained that I have been having a great deal of success with some front-end technologies and wanted to transition from a front-end focused position where I still engaged in full-stack development to a front-end only position. Now, this could be a habit of recruiters, but as they were lining up requirements from what I had experience in and the requirements companies had, they did not even feel comfortable to even propose me for some of their open reqs in front-end positions. This especially struck them as odd considering a large part of my background is in the .NET Microsoft technology stack. I then asked them the question, “can software developers in the .net ecosystem transition out of .net?” and this was met with an answer of “not very likely.”</p>
<p>This stunned me initially. As far back as I can remember, I’ve been told by mentors and developer peers that as long as you have a decent grasp in computer science concepts that it doesn’t matter what technology you code in. Back at RIT there was a course called “Programming Language Concepts.” It was my favorite course in college and I reflect on it now more than ever especially as the landscape of front-end engineering changing so rapidly. It taught us that it’s not the languages that we know, but the ideas and theories behind them. It exposed us and challenged us to solve problems in LISP, Perl, Python, Flex/Bison and identify how solving those problems was different in each language.<br>

        <p><img src="https://source.unsplash.com/X5Hjlv7nZU4" alt=""><br>I recently had a discussion with other friends in tech as to what they thought ethically about creating something, in tech, during free time at work. I made the argument that in my past there has been down time. In every career there is going to be some down time. Waiting on builds, whole company meetings that may not require your participation, waiting on code reviews, etc. etc.  </p>
<p>Many people I know choose to have quiet conversations at work about news, browse websites or make phone calls during this time. I was wondering about those who choose to be more productive and perhaps learn a new technology, write blog posts or contribute to open source code. As a software developer for a company, is it ethical for me to produce something in technologies that I know or am learning during business hours even if I’m using personal resources. </p>
<p>Nowadays in order to even apply to certain job postings, they require some sort of experience or online presence. Most suggest some sort of github activity, active community participation, or a blog. Developers already have so much on their plate right now that I find any off time during the work day that I spend reading hacker news or talking with coworkers to be somewhat unproductive. We have to be experts in the domain that we’re working with to effective iterate on the problems we’re solving. We have to have intimate knowledge in the technology we’re working on. We often have to meet deadlines that weren’t created by us, constrained by resources sometimes working more than 40 hour weeks. Lastly we have to stay up to date on newer technologies so that we’re still relevant and keep our interview skills sharp lest we forget exactly how to efficiently balance red black trees.<br>
