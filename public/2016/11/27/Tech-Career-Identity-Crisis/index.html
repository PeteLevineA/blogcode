<p>I have a mix of enthusiasm and experience in a myriad of technologies. Based on who may be reviewing my profiles or résumé, I could be anything from a senior software engineer, front-end developer, UI/UX developer, full stack developer, .net developer, etc. etc. etc. After my first 9 years of experience and the dissolution of the startup I was at, I began to really think about my place in the world of software engineering. Where should I take my career? Who am I? Am I really a senior software engineer? I love the front-end, could I be a front-end developer?</p>
<p>In the past, one of my companies had announced a big round of layoffs. The powers that be were being less than open about the state of the team I was on at the time. So I went and spoke to my recruiter about opportunities, where I was at with my career and what I wanted to do. I explained that I have been having a great deal of success with some front-end technologies and wanted to transition from a front-end focused position where I still engaged in full-stack development to a front-end only position. Now, this could be a habit of recruiters, but as they were lining up requirements from what I had experience in and the requirements companies had, they did not even feel comfortable to even propose me for some of their open reqs in front-end positions. This especially struck them as odd considering a large part of my background is in the .NET Microsoft technology stack. I then asked them the question, “can software developers in the .net ecosystem transition out of .net?” and this was met with an answer of “not very likely.”</p>
<p>This stunned me initially. As far back as I can remember, I’ve been told by mentors and developer peers that as long as you have a decent grasp in computer science concepts that it doesn’t matter what technology you code in. Back at RIT there was a course called “Programming Language Concepts.” It was my favorite course in college and I reflect on it now more than ever especially as the landscape of front-end engineering changing so rapidly. It taught us that it’s not the languages that we know, but the ideas and theories behind them. It exposed us and challenged us to solve problems in LISP, Perl, Python, Flex/Bison and identify how solving those problems was different in each language.<br><a id="more"></a></p>
<p>I then remember the age-old joke about software development recruiting. For any language, framework or SDK that just came out, there’s an open req requiring 5 years of experience in it. I remember the hundreds of tweets when Swift was announced at WWDC asking for 5 years of experience in it.<br><img src="http://imgur.com/07B3xK3.jpg “5 Years Required!”" alt="5 Years Experience"></p>
<p>So, despite focusing on the front-end of the engineering spectrum my entire career and writing more javascript than c#, I was labeled by my recruiter as a Microsoft .NET developer. I immediately realized that, like everything else, who you actually may be, means a lot less to someone looking at your experience than what your brand says you are. I personally went through a whole rebranding effort to remove as many mentions of “Microsoft” and “.NET” as I could. I imagine this is what it’s like at a company who wants to pivot. Hmm… should I add “rebranding strategy” to my résumé? Doing so, however, made me sad. I enjoy aspects of the .NET stack. I really enjoy C#, MVC and web api. I imagine this very thing is happening all over the world. Developers who I’ve met who can’t stand front-end development may have issues if they put javascript frameworks on their résumé. </p>
<p>One last point that drove this home to me was at a CodePen meetup I went to last year. It was a lightning talk meetup and I gave a quick talk about web performance, focusing on javascript. At the end of the night I was approached by a hiring manager at a company that asked about my previous experience and I accidently mentioned the Microsoft stack.  His eyes lit up as he was looking for .net developers to fill a specific role at his company. I tried, and failed, during the rest of the conversation to convey where my passions lie. Despite my experience in full stack development using the .net eco system, I am really passionate about front-end development. I thoroughly enjoy allowing humans to interact with technology.</p>
<p>Is who I am defined by the list of technologies that I write software against? I’m guessing I’m not the only developer to have this happen.</p>
