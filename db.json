I made the argument that in my past there has been down time. In every career there is going to be some down time. Waiting on builds, whole company meetings that may not require your participation, waiting on code reviews, etc. etc.  \n \nMany people I know choose to have quiet conversations at work about news, browse websites or make phone calls during this time. I was wondering about those who choose to be more productive and perhaps learn a new technology, write blog posts or contribute to open source code.

Developers already have so much on their plate right now that I find any off time during the work day that I spend reading hacker news or talking with coworkers to be somewhat unproductive. We have to be experts in the domain that we're working with to effective iterate on the problems we're solving. We have to have intimate knowledge in the technology we're working on. We often have to meet deadlines that weren't created by us, constrained by resources sometimes working more than 40 hour weeks. Lastly we have to stay up to date on newer technologies so that we're still relevant and keep our interview skills sharp lest we forget exactly how to efficiently balance red black trees. \n<!-- more -->\n\nI have been to meetings in the past where our head of department has outlined our budget. A question arose that asked about budget for continued education and training. The supervisor said point blank that in the real world, education and training are the first to go when a budget is under pressure. \nSo this is where my question comes from. If we need an online presence, keep our interview skills up to date and train ourselves outside of a normal working day, how do we be successful in all of these items especially if we have other outside items to attend to? How do we as developers continue to be developers if the odds are continuously stacked against us. It's no wonder that software developers and engineers move on to something else or create their own startup after working in the industry for a decade. \nThis is where my question comes from. Can we ethically produce an online presence or technical based content using skills we have likely acquired outside of work during work hours in our off time? What happens if that content can be monetized? \n \nI have a friend who stated that browsing websites, taking phone calls, having conversations is all part of a common work place and no one cares about the unproductive downtime use. But, if he caught one of his developers publishing a blog post at 2PM he would be warned and possibly terminated because the content of that blog post could be monetized. He stated the same for pull requests to open source software. If anything that the developer makes can be utilized by a competitor then it is grounds for termination if it's created during working hours no matter how unrelated to the company it is. \n \nI then countered that he sometimes is paid to speak at conferences for technologies he uses at work. There's no way of guaranteeing a competitor isn't in the audience and what, if any, percent of the script or talk was generated at work. What's the difference between speaking about something you've learned about at work, about X, technology than blogging about it? Typically I'd bet he'd make more financially at the conference than he would on ad revenue of an average blog post or youtube video on the subject.  \n \nI know some places have a clause stating anything created by an employee using any of the company's resources, ie. Building, wifi, power, etc is their property. In discussion with my friends about this, this is typically something you could probably negotiate at the time of employment. A lot of the time, however, something like this is stated in the employee handbook that we often sign without even reading. I personally know of board/quiet/conference room meetings held by employees talking about an idea that have eventually spawned into a startup or business. Now something like that is extremely difficult, in a court of law, to accuse an employee of doing that using business resources but where's the difference here between writing a blog post or talking to a fellow employee about a cool idea perhaps even using a pad of paper or whiteboard in a conference room. \n \nWhen I got to this section of the discussion we all came to a similar agreement. It's easy to find a pull request or blog posting timestamp during business hours and hard to find a timestamp for a business idea or script of a conference talk that might have occurred during those same business hours. The best possible solution that we came up with, is to talk to your supervisor or manager and determine what the company expects out of your knowledge and time. We all agreed that almost every one of the uses cases above, no company would likely ever come after you for unless you spawned a business that competes with the core of the business you're working for. However we all had our own answer for whether it was ethical. Is it ethical to produce open source pull requests or blog posts or conference speech scripts during office hours? \n \nIt seems like as technology evolves more is expected out of tech workers outside of simply producing code and architecting systems. As our career evolves over time we need to have open communication as to what is expected with our output both inside and outside of work. \n \nThis blog was written off hours in my free time.

Based on who may be reviewing my profiles or résumé, I could be anything from a senior software engineer, front-end developer, UI/UX developer, full stack developer, .net developer, etc. etc. etc. After my first 9 years of experience and the dissolution of the startup I was at, I began to really think about my place in the world of software engineering. Where should I take my career? Who am I? Am I really a senior software engineer? I love the front-end, could I be a front-end developer?\n\nIn the past, one of my companies had announced a big round of layoffs. The powers that be were being less than open about the state of the team I was on at the time. So I went and spoke to my recruiter about opportunities, where I was at with my career and what I wanted to do. I explained that I have been having a great deal of success with some front-end technologies and wanted to transition from a front-end focused position where I still engaged in full-stack development to a front-end only position. Now, this could be a habit of recruiters, but as they were lining up requirements from what I had experience in and the requirements companies had, they did not even feel comfortable to even propose me for some of their open reqs in front-end positions. This especially struck them as odd considering a large part of my background is in the .NET Microsoft technology stack. I then asked them the question, “can software developers in the .net ecosystem transition out of .net?” and this was met with an answer of “not very likely.”\n\nThis stunned me initially. As far back as I can remember, I’ve been told by mentors and developer peers that as long as you have a decent grasp in computer science concepts that it doesn’t matter what technology you code in. Back at RIT there was a course called “Programming Language Concepts.” It was my favorite course in college and I reflect on it now more than ever especially as the landscape of front-end engineering changing so rapidly. It taught us that it’s not the languages that we know, but the ideas and theories behind them. It exposed us and challenged us to solve problems in LISP, Perl, Python, Flex/Bison and identify how solving those problems was different in each language. \n<!-- more -->\n\nI then remember the age-old joke about software development recruiting. For any language, framework or SDK that just came out, there’s an open req requiring 5 years of experience in it. I remember the hundreds of tweets when Swift was announced at WWDC asking for 5 years of experience in it.\n![5 Years Experience](http://imgur.com/07B3xK3.jpg “5 Years Required!”)\n\nSo, despite focusing on the front-end of the engineering spectrum my entire career and writing more javascript than c#, I was labeled by my recruiter as a Microsoft .NET developer. I immediately realized that, like everything else, who you actually may be, means a lot less to someone looking at your experience than what your brand says you are. I personally went through a whole rebranding effort to remove as many mentions of “Microsoft” and “.NET” as I could. I imagine this is what it’s like at a company who wants to pivot. Hmm… should I add “rebranding strategy” to my résumé? Doing so, however, made me sad. I enjoy aspects of the .NET stack. I really enjoy C#, MVC and web api. I imagine this very thing is happening all over the world. Developers who I’ve met who can’t stand front-end development may have issues if they put javascript frameworks on their résumé. \n\nOne last point that drove this home to me was at a CodePen meetup I went to last year. It was a lightning talk meetup and I gave a quick talk about web performance, focusing on javascript. At the end of the night I was approached by a hiring manager at a company that asked about my previous experience and I accidently mentioned the Microsoft stack.  His eyes lit up as he was looking for .net developers to fill a specific role at his company. I tried, and failed, during the rest of the conversation to convey where my passions lie. Despite my experience in full stack development using the .net eco system, I am really passionate about front-end development. I thoroughly enjoy allowing humans to interact with technology.\n\nIs who I am defined by the list of technologies that I write software against? I’m guessing I’m not the only developer to have this happen.\n","source":"_posts/Tech-Career-Identity-Crisis.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Tech Career Identity Crisis\ndate: 2016-11-27 21:26:00\ncategories:\n- Careers\ntags: \n- developer\n- software engineer\n- front end\n- careers\n- tech\n---\n![](https://source.unsplash.com/5Ntkpxqt54Y \"\")\n\nI have a mix of enthusiasm and experience in a myriad of technologies.
